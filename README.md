# Portfolio Website

A portfolio highlighting some of my strongest work to date.

## Description

This is my static portfolio website, which was built as part of my CareerFoundry Full Stack Immersion program. The purpose of this project was to learn simple HTML and CSS, as well as pre and post processing, responsive design, and accessibility.
